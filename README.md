All the above projects have been created by me.
Maps and TheSahil are android projects and would be required to run on an emulator

All the rest are JAVA projects which have been created on eclipse.
Also applets have been made for SnakesAndLadders and AnalogClock.

Also I have created along with my teammate FlickrPhotos,which was created for Yahoo HackU! at IIT Kharagpur,which gets the location from where the user uses this app , and the app displays all searches related to his location.It can be run using a localhost server.

Apart from this I have also completed an algorithms course which has been done on C and C++.
